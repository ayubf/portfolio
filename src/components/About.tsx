            <p>
                I first got into programming when I was 11 years old. My older brother had gotten me into it, and my first coding experience was using ProcessingJS on KhanAcademy. 
                I dabbled in and out with programming and computer science for the next couple years, but I didn't do anything serious. My freshman year of high school I learned Python and wrote 
                a couple of very scuffed scripts but I was overall proud of myself. <br/> <br/>

                It was in my sophomore year that I was in the middle of figuring out what do in college. I stumbled over some of my old code and after talking to 
                my older brother, I made my mind up. I would major in Computer Science and from that moment I began to learn everything related to CS. I've learned a couple more languages and improved
                greatly but I still know I have a very long way to go and I'm ready to walk that path.
